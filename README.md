# Banking Risk Analysis Dashboard 📊

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end analysis and Power BI dashboard focused on risk, demographics, and product opportunities for a sample banking client base.

## 🗂 Project Structure

- `Banking_case1.pdf` – Power BI dashboard visuals with all major charts.
- `Banking_Insights.docx` – Concise summary of insights and strategic recommendations.
- `Risk_Analysis.ipynb` – Python notebook used for initial data exploration and modeling.
- `banking-clients.csv`, `gender.csv`, `investment-advisors.csv`, etc. – Cleaned datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal: **Deliver actionable business insights and risk segmentation using both data science and Power BI.**  
Key objectives:
- Profile client segments based on deposits, income, and loyalty.
- Understand risk distribution and product engagement.
- Identify cross-sell, upsell, and risk mitigation opportunities.

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- **Client Segmentation:** Loyalty tiers, age bands, and deposit sizes.
- **Deposits & Lending:** Distribution of deposits and loans by age and income band.
- **Risk Profile:** Breakdown by risk weighting and fee structure.
- **Property Ownership:** By nationality, occupation, and income band.
- **Demographics:** Gender, occupation, and high-value professions.

All visuals are available in `Banking_case1.pdf`.

## 💡 Summary of Insights

Some highlights from the analysis ([full details in Banking_Insights.docx](Banking_Insights.docx)):

- **High-value clients:** Platinum loyalty tier, older age groups, and Europeans are key for wealth management.
- **Opportunity segments:** Young (under 35) clients are mostly Jade/Silver and primed for engagement/loyalty upgrades.
- **Lending:** 74%+ of bank loans go to high-income bands; mid-income lending can be increased.
- **Risk:** Majority of clients are low-risk (Risk 1/2); high-risk clients (Risk 4/5) need closer monitoring.
- **Professions:** Asset-heavy occupations (professors, engineers, HR) are great targets for premium banking products.

## 📌 Recommendations

- Upsell loyalty and digital engagement for younger segments.
- Grow lending in the mid-income band.
- Proactively monitor high-risk client segments.
- Focus premium wealth offerings on European clients and asset-heavy professions.
